This skype extension lets you remove the messages which you
don't like to have on screen. This script immediately removes all
messages when a person in your chat which shouldn't see what you wrote about
him or about someone else comes online. 
Attention this script only works for messages you wrote 
yourself or messages you can edit
(rightclick on a message must show the oportunity "edit")

e.g.: You wan't to talk with a good friend about personal stuff
and you don't want your brother or your mother, who also has access to your computer
and maybe even your skype messages to read it.

e.g.: You are in a group chat with x,y and z.
(z is not online but when he comes online he will be able to read all you wrote) 
You all talk bad about z and you don't want him to read all 
the things you talked about him when he comes online

Before you can use the extension you must write your config.ini file

Below is an example
